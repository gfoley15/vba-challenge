# vba-challenge
This repository contains a VBA script designed to analyze stock data from multiple quarters within an Excel workbook. The script facilitates looping through each quarter, extracting and analyzing stock information, including:
 - Ticker symbol
 - Quarterly change from the opening price to the closing price
 - Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price
 - Total stock volume

The script includes functionality to identify the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume for each quarter.
Adjustments have been made to the script to enable it to run on every worksheet (quarter) simultaneously within the Excel workbook.

### Source code is saved in file called, VBA_script_file_stock_data - gfoley, within vba-challenge repo.
